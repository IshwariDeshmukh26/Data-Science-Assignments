<span> I’ve had the pleasure of testing out the Boat Air Dopes Bluetooth headset, and I must say, I’m thoroughly impressed. From its build quality to its performance, this device exceeded my expectations in many ways.<br><br/>Let’s start with the basics: sound quality. The Boat Air Dopes deliver crisp, clear sound with rich bass that truly elevates the listening experience. Whether I’m jamming out to my favorite tunes or taking calls on the go, the audio quality never disappoints. The clarity and depth of sound are simply remarkable, especially considering the price point of these earbuds.<br/><br/>Connectivity is another area where the Boat Air Dopes shine. Pairing them with my Android device was a breeze, and the connection has been rock solid ever since. Even when I tested them with my iPhone, I was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed. While there may be a slight lag compared to pricier alternatives like AirPods, it’s hardly noticeable in everyday use. Plus, the extended Bluetooth range means I can roam freely without worrying about losing connection.<br/><br/>Battery life is always a concern with wireless earbuds, but the Boat Air Dopes deliver impressive longevity. I can go hours without needing to recharge, making them perfect for long commutes, workouts, or just daily use. And when it’s time to juice them up, the included charging case makes it quick and convenient.<br/><br/>One feature that truly sets the Boat Air Dopes apart is their design. Sleek and stylish, these earbuds not only look great but also fit comfortably in my ears. The ergonomic design ensures a snug fit, so they stay put no matter how active I am. Plus, they’re lightweight and discreet, making them ideal for wearing on the go.<br/><br/>Overall, I can’t recommend the Boat Air Dopes enough. Whether you’re an Android user looking for top-notch performance or an iPhone user in search of a more budget-friendly option, these earbuds have you covered. With their superb sound quality, reliable connectivity, and impressive battery life, they’re a solid choice for anyone in the market for a new Bluetooth headset. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed.</br></span>

<span>The audio quality is fine for the price. They're heavily tuned out of the box with no way to tune it yourself. No app connectivity. You're left with two default EQ presets that you can change with touch controls.<br><br/>The noise suppression is too aggressive and the mic doesn't sound that great. But it's fine for this price range and it suppresses and good amount of noise. Good for calls but nor for meetings or anything that demands quality.<br/><br/>Touch controls are horrible on these headphones to a point I wish there was just an option to just turn them off. I almost always trigger them when I take them out of the case. It almost never activates properly when I actually want it to or you have to keep retrying. The touch and hold actions don't always trigger and you lift your finger only to find out it recognized what you did as a touch action and pauses/plays.<br/><br/>Why is ambient mode the first option when tapping and holding on right earbud for 3 seconds? Why isn't it ANC?  These earbuds are advertised as ANC earbuds, so maybe the people who buy these want to activate the ANC mode more quickly and not the ambient mode? The controls are poorly thought out.<br/>Why doesn't these earbuds remember the mode I selected? Why do I have to cycle through normal mode and ambient mode just to activate ANC? This is horrible user experience.<br/>Honestly, if I knew it was this bad, I wouldn't buy these. You won't find these annoying until you have used these for a while and by then, the return window would close.<br/><br/>If you care about the things I mentioned above, please don't buy these earbuds.</br></span>

<span>I purchased the Boat Airdrops and received my order on 28th May 2024. Initially, I was quite pleased with the product as they worked perfectly for the first 10 days. The sound quality was good, and they were comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after the 10-day mark, I started experiencing significant issues.<br/><br/>The earbuds began to malfunction in several ways. The left earbud would often disconnect randomly, and the battery life diminished noticeably. Additionally, there were intermittent connectivity problems, which were highly frustrating during calls and music playback.<br/><br/>Given these issues, I no longer have the original box or packaging, but I would like to request either a replacement of the defective unit or a repair. I hope that Boat can address these problems promptly as I was initially very satisfied with the product and would like to continue using it without these disruptions.<br/><br/>I look forward to a positive resolution to this matter. Thank you.</span>

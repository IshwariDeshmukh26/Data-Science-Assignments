0,5.0,Amazing show!  Seaaon 2 is great!
1,1.5,"Nice, friendly and harmless, but a little too boring for me."
2,5.0,For me it had some Ricky Gervais moments - more so than series 1. Still found it delightful and wonderfully Australian somehow

4,3.5,"The first series was lovely. It was well written, funny and tender. After watching and hating the first three episodes of series 2 I gave the series 2 stars as I found it vulgar and unfunny. I persevered and found the later episodes had much of the humour and quirky charm of the first series so upgraded my score to 3 and a half stars."
5,5.0,"One of the best shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Not much makes laugh out loud but this show... my god.

I'm so sad I don't have another episode to watch. Season 3?"
6,4.5,This show is one of the best on TV right now. The second season adds even more depth while remaining absolutely hilarious.
7,5.0,One of the best shows on Telly atm. Love it!
8,3.5,"I love this series.
Season 1 was good, season 2 was great!
I did notice the nRL product placement in the second season, thought a more ‘Aussie AFL theme’ would have given the show more recognition and a unique aspect. I know the program is based in Sydney- not a Swans supporter but would have fitted perfectly."
